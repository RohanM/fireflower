# The Fireflower - LED Strip Control Code

The Fireflower is an art installation that featured at Rainbow Serpent Festival 2015. Taking the 
form of a lotus flower (~10 m diameter), its central petals hide a chamber with an interactive light
display.

Five LED strips form leaf vein patterns on the inside of the petals, and several hammocks sit inside
the inner space. When a participant sits in one of the hammocks, the light display on the petals
lights up to welcome them.

The following code (running on an Arduino) reads from a stretch sensor and outputs various patterns to
the five attached LED strips to achieve this effect.
